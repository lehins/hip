Installation
------------

Install HIP using `cabal`:

* `$ cabal update && cabal install hip`

and using `stack`:

* `$ stack install hip`

In order to be able to view images in GHCi an external image viewer is used. You
can use any viewer that accepts a filename as an argument, and by default, image
viewer specified by the OS is used.
